README - Vidiprinter

Please note this project, although functional, is a work-in-progress.

Vidiprinter is a Python script designed for the Raspberry Pi which brings in information form multiple sources and displayes them as a ticker on the screen, like those on Final Score/Soccer Saturday.

Currently, the project supports the following sources:
-- Tweets from @SkyNewsBreak
-- New emails from a Gmail account
-- Facebook notifications
-- Clock (the time is printed every 15 minutes)

Other planned sources include:
-- Any IMAP email
-- Facebook messages
-- Public transport databases
-- Google Calendar

When the program is first launched, you will be prompted for a series of credentials. These can be changed at a later date by running VidiprinterSettings.py

Vidiprinter is dependent on a number of Python modules, all of which can be be installed using 'sudo easy_isntall modulename'. These are listed at the top of the Python script.

TODO list
-- Add the sources listed above
-- Turn sources on or of
-- Interface with an LCD screen
-- Audible alert when something updates
