README - Vidiprinter

Please note this project, although functional, is a work-in-progress and is currently missing key features such as a settings panel.

Vidiprinter is a Python script which brings in information form multiple sources and displayes them as a ticker on the screen, like those on Final Score/Soccer Saturday.

Currently, the project supports the following sources:
-- Tweets from @SkyNewsBreak
-- New emails from a Gmail account
-- Facebook notifications
-- Clock (the time is printed every 15 minutes)

Other planned sources include:
-- Any IMAP email
-- Facebook messages
-- Public transport databases
-- Google Calendar

TODO list
-- Add the sources listed above
-- Create a settings panel allowing you to:
	- Turn sources on or off
	- Change already entered information
-- Interface with an LCD screen
-- Audible alert when something updates
